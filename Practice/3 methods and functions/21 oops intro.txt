In this lecture we will learn:
- What is OOPs?
- Different programming paradigms in python
- What is object-oriented programming?
- What are objects?
- What is the class in OOPs?


#1
- OOPs stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
- Python supports different programming paradigms.
It supports:
1) Functional Programming 
Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which we try to bind everything in a pure mathematical functions style. 

2) Object Oriented Programming
 It is a programming pattern that rounds around an object or entity is called object-oriented programming.

3) Procedure Oriented Programming
Procedure-oriented programming contains a group of instructions known as function. There are multiple functions in the program.

#2
- In the real world, everything is an object.
e.g., to click the photo, the camera is an object.
 to work in a company, their employees are objects.
- Every object has two things:-
1. Attributes (An object knows something)
2. Behaviour (An object does something)
- An object can also have multiple properties as well as multiple behaviours.
- Variables are used to store data or attributes in an object.
- Methods are used to define the behaviour of an object.
- Methods in object-oriented programming are similar to functions.

#3
-A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.
- In programming, a class is used to write the design of a program.
- Class is the design and an object is an instance.
