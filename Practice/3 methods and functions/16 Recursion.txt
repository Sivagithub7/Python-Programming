#1
- Recursion means calling a function from itself.
- To print a statement of a function multiple times, we can call a function inside the same function.
- By default, a function inside a function will execute infinite times.
- Maximum limit for recursion is 1000 in python, so it will give an error after exceeding its limit.
- Limit can also be changed by doing some customization.
- If a code goes into recursion without a condition and it goes to infinite times, then it may hang the system and that limit is set in python.
- We can also print the limit of recursion by using the function getrecursionlimit() available in the sys library.
- We can change the limit for a recursion by using the setrecursionlimit() function.
- We can set the limit to any number by providing it in the setrecursionlimit() method.
- We have to make the variable global to access it if it is defined outside the scope.
- Recursion is used to perform several tasks in many projects.

#2
- A complicated function can be split down into smaller sub-problems by using the recursion.
- Recursive functions make the code look simple and effective.

import sys
sys.setrecursionlimit(200)
print(sys.setrecursionlimit())

i=0
def greek():
    global i
    i=+1
    print("Hello ",i)
    greek()  --- we are giving another func

greek()
