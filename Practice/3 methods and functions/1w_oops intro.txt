In this lecture we will learn:
- What is OOPs?
- Different programming paradigms in python
- What is object-oriented programming?
- What are objects?
- What is the class in OOPs?


#1
- OOPs stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
- Python supports different programming paradigms.
It supports:
1) Functional Programming 
Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which we try to bind everything in a pure mathematical functions style. 

2) Object Oriented Programming
 It is a programming pattern that rounds around an object or entity is called object-oriented programming.

3) Procedure Oriented Programming
Procedure-oriented programming contains a group of instructions known as function. There are multiple functions in the program.

#2
- In the real world, everything is an object.
e.g., to click the photo, the camera is an object.
 to work in a company, their employees are objects.
- Every object has two things:-
1. Attributes (An object knows something)
2. Behaviour (An object does something)
- An object can also have multiple properties as well as multiple behaviours.
- Variables are used to store data or attributes in an object.
- Methods are used to define the behaviour of an object.
- Methods in object-oriented programming are similar to functions.

#3
-A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.
- In programming, a class is used to write the design of a program.
- Class is the design and an object is an instance.

=========================================
OOPS:
A language that supports all the principles of an oriented programming is known as an oops.

Object Oriented Principles(OOPs):
1) Encapsulation
2) Abstraction
3) Inheritance
4) Polymorphism

Object Oriented = Object Based + Inheritance + Runtime

Polymorphism Object Oriented Languages:
C++, Java, VC++, C#.Net, Visual Basic.Net, Simula, Ada, Small Talk, Python, ..etc.,

Object Based Languages:
Java Script, VB Script, Visual Basic, .. etc.,

In order to use the above principles in a Java programming we need the following
language constructs:
1) Class
2) Object

1)Class: A class is a collection of variables & methods.
A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.
What do we mean by a prototype?
Prototype - Wikipedia
A prototype is an early sample, model, or release of a product built to test a concept or process.


Objects:Object is an instance of a class.
What are objects in Python?
Objects are variables that contain data and functions that can be used to manipulate the data. 

Methods:Methods in objects are functions that belong to the object.
Method is called by its name, but it is associated to an object (dependent).
A method definition always includes ‘self’ as its first parameter

Functions:Function is block of code that is also called by its name. (independent)
The function can have different parameters or may not have any at all. If any data (parameters) are passed, they are passed explicitly.

ex:
class VivoMobiles:
    x=99
    def samplemethod(self):
        print(self.x)
obj1=VivoMobiles()                               
obj1.samplemethod()

VivoMobiles.samplemethod(obj1)

note: here 7 th and 8 th lines same result
o/p:
99
99

ex:

class VivoMobiles:
    def __init__(self):
        print("enter any:")
    def example(self):
        print("example is:")

obj1=VivoMobiles()

o/p:
enter any:

ex:

class Vivomobiles:
    def __init__(self):
        self.model='model'
        self.ram='ram'
        self.rom='rom'

    def info(self):
        print('vivo',self.model,'info:')
        print('model -',self.model)
        print('ram -', self.ram)
        print('rom -', self.rom)

mobile1=Vivomobiles()
mobile1.model='v20'
mobile1.ram='8gb'
mobile1.rom='126gb'
mobile1.info()
print('')
mobile2=Vivomobiles()
mobile2.model='x19'
mobile2.ram='12gb'
mobile2.rom='84gb'
mobile2.info()

o/p:
vivo v20 info:
model - v20
ram - 8gb
rom - 126gb

vivo x19 info:
model - x19
ram - 12gb
rom - 84gb

==============================================================
Variables:
A variable is a container that contains data.
There are 2 types of variables in Java:
1) Instance Variables
2) Class Variables

1) Instance Variables:A variable that is defined as a member of a class is known as an instance
variable.

2) Class Variables:A variable that is defined as a static member of a class is known as class variable.

Class variables are defined within a class but outside any of the class's methods.
ex:

class Bike:
    #class or static variables
    tyres=2
    def __init__(self):
        #instance variables
        self.name='bike name  '
        self.year=('2020')
        self.mileage='40kmph'

bike1=Bike()
bike1.name='activa '
bike2=Bike()
bike2.name='unicorn'
bike2.year='2022'
bike2.mileage='80kmph'

print(bike1.name  ,bike1.year,bike1.mileage,Bike.tyres)

print(bike2.name,bike2.year,bike2.mileage,Bike.tyres)

0/p:
activa  2020 40kmph 2
unicorn 2022 80kmph 2

note:
 we cant change class variable it should be applicable to all
