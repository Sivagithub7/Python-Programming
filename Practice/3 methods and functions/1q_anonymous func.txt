In this lecture we will learn:
- Anonymous Function in Python
- What are lambda functions?
- How to define lambda functions?
- Normal and Anonymous functions in Python
- Advantages of lambda fucntions


#1
- Normal functions are defined by using the def keyword and function name.
- A function without a function name is known as an Anonymous function.
- Anonymous function is called a lambda function.
- Functions are objects in Python so we can also pass a function in a function.
- Instead of defining a function, we can directly define it whenever it is required to use.
- We have to use the lambda keyword to directly define the function in one line.
- We need to store the lambda function in a variable as the function is also an object.
- Then, that variable will define the function and we can also use it in other functions.
- We can pass any number of arguments in a lambda function but it should be only one expression.
- Lambda functions are syntactically restricted to a single expression.

#2
Advantages of Lambda Function:-
- Lambda function supports single-line statements that return some value.
- It is useful when we have to perform short operations and data manipulations.
- It saves the time as it requires less time to read the code.


f=lambda a,b : a+b
result=f(5,6)
print(result)
