Comparison Operators
In this lecture we will be learning about Comparison Operators in Python. These operators will allow us to compare variables and output a Boolean value (True or False).

If you have any sort of background in Math, these operators should be very straight forward.

First we'll present a table of the comparison operators and then work through some examples:

Table of Comparison Operators
In the table below, a=3 and b=4.

Operator	Description	Example
==	If the values of two operands are equal, then the condition becomes true.	(a == b) is not true.
!=	If values of two operands are not equal, then condition becomes true.	(a != b) is true
>	If the value of left operand is greater than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	(a > b) is not true.
<	If the value of left operand is less than the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	(a < b) is true.
>=	If the value of left operand is greater than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	(a >= b) is not true.
<=	If the value of left operand is less than or equal to the value of right operand, then condition becomes true.	(a <= b) is true.
Let's now work through quick examples of each of these.

Equal
2 == 2
True
1 == 0
False
Note that == is a comparison operator, while = is an assignment operator.

Not Equal
2 != 1
True
2 != 2
False
Greater Than
2 > 1
True
2 > 4
False
Less Than
2 < 4
True
2 < 1
False
Greater Than or Equal to
2 >= 2
True
2 >= 1
True
Less than or Equal to
2 <= 2
True
2 <= 4
True
Great! Go over each comparison operator to make sure you understand what each one is saying. But hopefully this was straightforward for you.

Next we will cover chained comparison operators
=================================

Chained Comparison Operators
An interesting feature of Python is the ability to chain multiple comparisons to perform a more complex test. You can use these chained comparisons as shorthand for larger Boolean Expressions.

In this lecture we will learn how to chain comparison operators and we will also introduce two other important statements in Python: and and or.

Let's look at a few examples of using chains:

1 < 2 < 3
True
The above statement checks if 1 was less than 2 and if 2 was less than 3. We could have written this using an and statement in Python:

1<2 and 2<3
True
The and is used to make sure two checks have to be true in order for the total check to be true. Let's see another example:

1 < 3 > 2
True
The above checks if 3 is larger than both of the other numbers, so you could use and to rewrite it as:

1<3 and 3>2
True
It's important to note that Python is checking both instances of the comparisons. We can also use or to write comparisons in Python. For example:

1==2 or 2<3
True
Note how it was true; this is because with the or operator, we only need one or the other to be true. Let's see one more example to drive this home:

1==1 or 100==1
True
Great! For an overview of this quick lesson: You should have a comfortable understanding of using and and or statements as well as reading chained comparison code.
