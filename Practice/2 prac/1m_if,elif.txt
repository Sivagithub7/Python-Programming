>e.g. 86 is even because 86 Ã· 2 = 43

43 does not have any decimal places. Therefore the division is clean.

e.g. 59 is odd because 59 Ã· 2 = 29.5

29.5 is not a whole number, it has decimal places. Therefore there is a remainder of 0.5, so the division is not clean.

The modulo is written as a percentage sign (%) in Python. It gives you the remainder after a division.

e.g.

6 Ã· 2 = 3 with no remainder.

therefore: 6 % 2 = 0

5 Ã· 2 = 2 x 2 + 1, remainder is 1.

therefore: 5 % 2 = 1

14 Ã· 4 = 3 x 4 + 2, remainder is 2.

therefore: 14 % 4 = 2

BMI:
Write a program that interprets the Body Mass Index (BMI) based on a user's weight and height.

It should tell them the interpretation of their BMI based on the BMI value.

Under 18.5 they are underweight
Over 18.5 but below 25 they have a normal weight
Equal to or over 25 but below 30 they are slightly overweight
Equal to or over 30 but below 35 they are obese
Equal to or over 35 they are clinically obese.
BMI Chart

The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):

BMI Formula

Important: you do not need to round the result to the nearest whole number. It's fine to print out a floating point number for this exercise. The interpretation message needs to include the words in bold from the interpretations above. e.g. underweight, normal weight, overweight, obese, clinically obese.

Example Input 1
1.50
63
Example Output 1
Your BMI is 28.0, you are slightly overweight.
since 63 Ã· (1.50 x 1.50) = 28

The testing code will check for print output that is formatted like one of the lines below:

"Your BMI is 18.28678, you are underweight."
"Your BMI is 22.0, you have a normal weight."
"Your BMI is 28.50752, you are slightly overweight."
"Your BMI is 32.56189, you are obese."
"Your BMI is 37.50000, you are clinically obese."
Example Input 2

Write a program that works out whether if a given year is a leap year. A normal year has 365 days, leap years have 366, with an extra day in February. The reason why we have leap years is really fascinating, this video does it more justice.

This is how you work out whether if a particular year is a leap year.

on every year that is divisible by 4 with no remainder

except every year that is evenly divisible by 100 with no remainder

unless the year is also divisible by 400 with no remainder

If english is not your first language or if the above logic is confusing, try using this flow chart .

e.g. The year 2000:

2000 Ã· 4 = 500 (Leap)

2000 Ã· 100 = 20 (Not Leap)

2000 Ã· 400 = 5 (Leap!)

So the year 2000 is a leap year.

But the year 2100 is not a leap year because:

2100 Ã· 4 = 525 (Leap)

2100 Ã· 100 = 21 (Not Leap)

2100 Ã· 400 = 5.25 (Not Leap)

Warning your output should match the Example Output format exactly, including spelling an punctuation.

Example Input 1
2400
Example Output 1
Leap year
Example Input 2
1989
Example Output 2
Not leap year

sol:

# Which year do you want to check?
year = int(input())

> Love calculator:
Instructions
ðŸ’ª This is a difficult challenge! ðŸ’ª
You are going to write a program that tests the compatibility between two people.

To work out the love score between two people:

Take both people's names and check for the number of times the letters in the word TRUE occurs.

Then check for the number of times the letters in the word LOVE occurs.

Then combine these numbers to make a 2 digit number.

For Love Scores less than 10 or greater than 90, the message should be:

"Your score is *x*, you go together like coke and mentos."
For Love Scores between 40 and 50, the message should be:

"Your score is *y*, you are alright together."
Otherwise, the message will just be their score. e.g.:

"Your score is *z*."
e.g.

name1 = "Angela Yu"
name2 = "Jack Bauer"
T occurs 0 times

R occurs 1 time

U occurs 2 times

E occurs 2 times

Total = 5

L occurs 1 time

O occurs 0 times

V occurs 0 times

E occurs 2 times

Total = 3

Love Score = 53

Print: "Your score is 53."

These functions will help you:

if, elif, else Statements
if Statements in Python allows us to tell the computer to perform alternative actions based on a certain set of results.

Verbally, we can imagine we are telling the computer:

"Hey if this case happens, perform some action"

We can then expand the idea further with elif and else statements, which allow us to tell the computer:

"Hey if this case happens, perform some action. Else, if another case happens, perform some other action. Else, if none of the above cases happened, perform this action."

Let's go ahead and look at the syntax format for if statements to get a better idea of this:

if case1:
    perform action1
elif case2:
    perform action2
else: 
    perform action3
First Example
Let's see a quick example of this:

if True:
    print('It was true!')
It was true!
Let's add in some else logic:

x = False

if x:
    print('x was True!')
else:
    print('I will be printed in any case where x is not true')
I will be printed in any case where x is not true
Multiple Branches
Let's get a fuller picture of how far if, elif, and else can take us!

We write this out in a nested structure. Take note of how the if, elif, and else line up in the code. This can help you see what if is related to what elif or else statements.

We'll reintroduce a comparison syntax for Python.

loc = 'Bank'

if loc == 'Auto Shop':
    print('Welcome to the Auto Shop!')
elif loc == 'Bank':
    print('Welcome to the bank!')
else:
    print('Where are you?')
Welcome to the bank!
Note how the nested if statements are each checked until a True boolean causes the nested code below it to run. You should also note that you can put in as many elif statements as you want before you close off with an else.

Let's create two more simple examples for the if, elif, and else statements:

person = 'Sammy'

if person == 'Sammy':
    print('Welcome Sammy!')
else:
    print("Welcome, what's your name?")
Welcome Sammy!
person = 'George'

if person == 'Sammy':
    print('Welcome Sammy!')
elif person =='George':
    print('Welcome George!')
else:
    print("Welcome, what's your name?")
Welcome George!
Indentation
It is important to keep a good understanding of how indentation works in Python to maintain the structure and order of your code. We will touch on this topic again when we start building out functions!
