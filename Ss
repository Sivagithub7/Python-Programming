Project Scope and Requirements
Environment Replication Goals: Set up resources in a local environment that mirrors ASDA’s, utilizing the following:
Azure Account - Hosts Azure DevOps pipelines and Azure Storage Account.
Cloudflare Account (TCS) - Manages DNS resources and tracks changes, including creation, deletion, and imports.
Key Technologies: Azure DevOps, Cloudflare, Terraform, GitHub, Azure Storage Account.
3. Solution Architecture
Continuous Integration Pipeline:
Source Control: All YAML files and Terraform (.tf) files are maintained in a private GitHub repository.
Pipeline Triggers: A CI pipeline is triggered to automate resource creation, updates, and domain import.
4. Detailed Workflow
Step 1: Resource Management Using Terraform

Terraform scripts handle resource provisioning within Cloudflare.
A dedicated backend configuration within Azure Storage Account enables state management, tracking all infrastructure changes.
Step 2: Pipeline Execution in Azure DevOps

Pipeline tasks include executing YAML scripts for Terraform operations, covering both creation and destruction of resources.
A separate YAML script for importing existing domains captures and tracks domain configurations, storing the state file in Azure Storage.
5. Technical Components
Providers Used:

Azure DevOps: For CI/CD pipelines.
Cloudflare (TCS Account): For DNS resource management.
YAML Scripts:

Configured to automate Terraform execution.
Import YAML script integrates existing domain configurations into the Terraform state, with updates stored in the Azure Storage Account.
Backend State Management: Azure Storage Account holds the Terraform state file, ensuring an up-to-date record of infrastructure.

6. Benefits and Expected Outcomes
Streamlined CI/CD with automated resource tracking and state management.
Efficiency Gains: Reduces manual effort in DNS management and configuration replication.
Scalability and Flexibility for future expansions or modifications.
7. Conclusion
Summary: This POC demonstrates the feasibility and value of using Azure DevOps and Terraform for replicating enterprise-level environments with continuous integration and automated resource management.
Additional Suggestions:
Diagrams and Visuals:
Include a high-level architecture diagram showing the interaction between Azure DevOps, Cloudflare, Azure Storage, and GitHub.
Screenshots or Code Snippets:
Highlight key YAML and .tf configurations for clarity.
Appendices:
Attach the YAML and Terraform code as appendices or links to GitHub if sharing with technical stakeholders.
This structure would provide a clear, professional overview, helping clients understand the scope, components, and benefits of the solution. Let me know if you’d like assistance expanding on any section or creating diagrams!
